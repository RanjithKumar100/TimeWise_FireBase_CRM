## 🚀 NEXT STEPS TO MAKE IT WORK

### Step 1: Setup Hostname on Your Server
```cmd
# Right-click and "Run as Administrator"
SETUP-TIMEWISE-HOSTNAME.bat
```
This adds `192.168.1.43 timewise` to your server's hosts file.

### Step 2: Choose Network Setup Method

#### 🏠 **Option A: Router DNS (BEST for everyone)**
1. Access your router: `http://192.168.1.1`
2. Find "Local DNS" or "Host Names" section
3. Add: `timewise` → `192.168.1.43`
4. Save and restart router
5. **Result**: ALL devices automatically use `http://timewise:9002`

#### 💻 **Option B: Individual Device Setup**
- Windows: Run hostname setup on each PC
- Mac/Linux: Edit hosts file on each device
- Mobile: Use router method (recommended)

### Step 3: Start Your Server
```cmd
start-timewise.bat
```
This will:
- Kill any port conflicts
- Check hostname resolution  
- Start server on port 9002
- Show all access URLs

### Step 4: Test Access
- Open browser: `http://timewise:9002`
- Should show TimeWise login page
- Login with your existing credentials
