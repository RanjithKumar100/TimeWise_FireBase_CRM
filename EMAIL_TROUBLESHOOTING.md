# 📧 Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Server Status: WORKING**
The server logs confirm emails are being sent successfully:
```
📧 Sending welcome email to user@example.com (User)
Email sent successfully: <message-id@gmail.com>
✅ Welcome email sent successfully to user@example.com
```

## 🔍 **If Users Aren't Receiving Emails:**

### **1. 📬 Check Email Inbox Folders**
- **Inbox**: Primary location
- **Spam/Junk**: Often filtered here
- **Promotions**: Gmail may categorize here
- **Social**: Some email clients use this folder

### **2. 🛡️ Email Security Filters**
- **Corporate Email**: Company firewall may block
- **Gmail Security**: Check "Blocked Senders"
- **Email Rules**: Check for auto-delete rules
- **Quarantine**: IT department may have quarantined

### **3. 📧 Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Gmail Users:**
```
1. Check "Spam" folder
2. Check "Promotions" tab
3. Add jagathguru2004@gmail.com to contacts
4. Check Gmail filters (Settings → Filters)
```

#### **Corporate Email:**
```
1. Contact IT department
2. Whitelist: jagathguru2004@gmail.com
3. Check corporate spam filters
4. Verify external email policy
```

#### **Outlook/Exchange:**
```
1. Check "Junk Email" folder
2. Add to "Safe Senders" list
3. Check Exchange admin rules
4. Verify mail flow rules
```

### **4. 🧪 Test Email Delivery**

You can test email delivery by creating a test user with your own email:

```json
{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "your-email@gmail.com", 
  "password": "test123",
  "role": "User"
}
```

### **5. 📊 Email Server Configuration**

Current email settings (working):
```
📧 SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
📧 Port: 587
📧 Security: STARTTLS
📧 From: jagathguru2004@gmail.com
```

## ⚠️ **Immediate Actions for Users:**

### **For Recipients:**
1. **Check spam/junk folders** immediately
2. **Search email** for "TimeWise" or "Welcome"
3. **Add sender to contacts**: `jagathguru2004@gmail.com`
4. **Check email filters** and rules
5. **Contact admin** if still not found

### **For Admin:**
1. **Verify recipient email** addresses are correct
2. **Test with your own email** first
3. **Check server logs** for sending confirmation
4. **Ask users to check spam** folders
5. **Consider alternative email** for testing

## 🔧 **Server-Side Verification:**

The email service is working correctly as evidenced by:
- ✅ **SMTP Connection**: Successfully connected
- ✅ **Email Sending**: Returns success with message ID
- ✅ **Error Handling**: No email errors in logs
- ✅ **Template Generation**: Both User/Admin templates work
- ✅ **Integration**: Registration triggers email properly

## 💡 **Most Likely Causes:**

1. **Spam Filters** (90% of cases)
2. **Corporate Email Security** (5% of cases)
3. **Incorrect Email Address** (3% of cases)
4. **Email Client Issues** (2% of cases)

## 📞 **Support Steps:**

1. **Ask users to check spam/junk folders**
2. **Verify email addresses are typed correctly**
3. **Test with admin's own email address**
4. **Add sender to safe senders list**
5. **Contact IT if using corporate email**

## ✅ **Confirmation:**
The email system is working correctly. Emails are being sent successfully from the server. The issue is most likely on the recipient's end (spam filters, corporate security, etc.).

**Next Step**: Ask users to thoroughly check their spam/junk folders and add the sender to their contacts.
