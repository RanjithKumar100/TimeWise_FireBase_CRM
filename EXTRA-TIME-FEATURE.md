# ‚è∞ Extra Time Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added an "Extra Time" feature to the admin panel that calculates and displays overtime hours when employees log more than 8 hours per day.

## ‚ú® Features Added

### 1. **Extra Time Calculation Logic**
- **Standard Work Hours**: 8 hours per day
- **Extra Time**: Any hours logged above 8 hours per day
- **Daily Calculation**: Groups all entries by employee and date, then calculates overtime
- **Example**: If a user logs 9.5 hours on one day ‚Üí 1.5 hours extra time

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Stats Card**
- New "Extra Time (Month)" card in admin dashboard
- Shows total overtime hours for the current month across all employees

### 3. **Team Summary Table Enhancement**
- Added "Extra Time" column to the Team Overall Hours table
- Shows total overtime hours per employee in human-readable format
- Color-coded in orange (#text-orange-600) for visual emphasis
- Displays as "2h 30m" format (e.g., 2 hours 30 minutes)

### 4. **Excel Export Enhancement**
- Main export now includes all existing timesheet data
- Added separate "Extra Time Summary" sheet with:
  - Employee name and email
  - Total extra time per employee in readable format

export function calculateDailyExtraTime(entries: TimesheetEntry[]): Map<string, number>

// Calculate total extra time for a specific employee
export function calculateEmployeeExtraTime(entries: TimesheetEntry[], employeeId: string): number

// Format hours as "2h 30m" or "0h"
export function formatExtraTime(hours: number): string
```

- **Employee A - Day 2**: 
  - Entry 1: 8 hours
  - **Total**: 8 hours ‚Üí **Extra**: 0 hours
