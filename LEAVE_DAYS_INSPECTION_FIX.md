# Leave Days Fix - Inspection Dashboard

## Summary
Fixed the Inspection dashboard to recognize **company leave days** (holidays/festivals) set by admins in Leave Management. Previously, leave days were showing as **missing entries with red X marks**. Now they display correctly as **non-work days in purple** and are excluded from compliance calculations.

---

## Problem

### Before Fix:
When an admin set a day as a company leave (festival/holiday) in **Dashboard ‚Üí Leave Management**, the Inspection page would:
- ‚ùå **Mark it as missing entry** (red X mark)
- ‚ùå **Count it in total work days**
- ‚ùå **Lower compliance percentage** incorrectly
- ‚ùå **Show in missing dates list**

### Example Scenario:
```
Admin sets: January 26, 2025 (Republic Day) as leave
Expected: Purple "Company Leave" badge
Actual: ‚ùå Red "Missing Entry" mark

User Compliance: 20/21 days = 95%  ‚ùå WRONG!
Should be: 20/20 days = 100% ‚úÖ (excluding leave day)
```

---

## Root Cause

The Inspection dashboard had two issues:

1. **Compliance Stats Calculation** ([src/app/dashboard/inspection/page.tsx](src/app/dashboard/inspection/page.tsx))
   - `getWorkDaysInRange()` only excluded Sundays & 2nd Saturdays
   - **Didn't fetch or check company leave days**
   - Counted leave days as expected work days

2. **Calendar View** ([src/components/inspection/compliance-calendar-view.tsx](src/components/inspection/compliance-calendar-view.tsx))
   - `calculateMonthStats()` didn't check leave days
   - `getDayStatus()` didn't mark leave days
   - Leave days showed as missing entries (red)

---

## Solution

### 1. Inspection Dashboard Page ([src/app/dashboard/inspection/page.tsx](src/app/dashboard/inspection/page.tsx))

#### **Added Leave Date Fetching:**
```typescript
const [leaveDates, setLeaveDates] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

const fetchLeaveDates = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/leaves', { ... });
  const leaves = result.data.leaves || [];
  const leaveDateStrings = new Set(
    leaves.map((leave: any) => formatDateForAPI(new Date(leave.date)))
  );
  setLeaveDates(leaveDateStrings);
  console.log('üìÖ Fetched leave dates:', Array.from(leaveDateStrings));
};

// Fetch on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUsers();
  fetchLeaveDates();  // NEW
}, []);
```

#### **Updated Work Days Calculation:**
```typescript
const getWorkDaysInRange = (start: Date, end: Date): number => {
  // ... existing logic for Sundays and 2nd Saturdays ...

  // NEW: Exclude company leave days
  if (leaveDates.has(dateString)) {
    current.setDate(current.getDate() + 1);
    continue;
  }

  count++;  // Only count if not a leave day
};
```

#### **Updated Missing Days Detection:**
```typescript
const getMissingWorkDays = (start: Date, end: Date, completedDates: string[]): string[] => {
  // ... existing logic ...

  // NEW: Exclude company leave days (festivals/holidays)
  if (leaveDates.has(dateString)) {
    current.setDate(current.getDate() + 1);
    continue;
  }

  // Only mark as missing if it's actually a work day
  if (!completedSet.has(dateString)) {
    missing.push(dateString);
  }
};
```

---

### 2. Compliance Calendar View ([src/components/inspection/compliance-calendar-view.tsx](src/components/inspection/compliance-calendar-view.tsx))

#### **Added Leave Date State:**
```typescript
const [leaveDates, setLeaveDates] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

const fetchLeaveDates = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/leaves', { ... });
  const leaves = result.data.leaves || [];
  const leaveDateStrings = new Set(
    leaves.map((leave: any) => formatDateForAPI(new Date(leave.date)))
  );
  setLeaveDates(leaveDateStrings);
  console.log('üìÖ Fetched leave dates for calendar:', Array.from(leaveDateStrings));
};
```

#### **Updated Day Status Interface:**
```typescript
interface DayStatus {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isLeaveDay?: boolean;  // NEW
}
```

#### **Updated Work Days Filter:**
```typescript
const workDays = days.filter(day => {
  const dateString = formatDateForAPI(day);

  // Exclude future dates
  if (day > new Date()) return false;

  // Exclude Sundays
  if (dayOfWeek === 0) return false;

  // Exclude second Saturday
  if (dayOfWeek === 6 && isSecondSaturday) return false;

  // NEW: Exclude company leave days (festivals/holidays)
  if (leaveDates.has(dateString)) return false;

  return true;
});
```

#### **Updated Day Status Detection:**
```typescript
const getDayStatus = (date: Date): DayStatus => {
  const dateString = formatDateForAPI(date);
  const isLeaveDay = leaveDates.has(dateString);  // NEW

  let isWorkDay = true;

  if (dayOfWeek === 0) {
    isWorkDay = false; // Sunday
  } else if (isSecondSaturday) {
    isWorkDay = false; // Second Saturday
  } else if (isLeaveDay) {
    isWorkDay = false; // NEW: Company leave day
  }

  return {
    // ...
    isLeaveDay  // NEW
  };
};
```

#### **Updated Visual Styling:**
```typescript
const getDayColor = (dayStatus: DayStatus) => {
  if (dayStatus.isLeaveDay) return 'bg-purple-50 text-purple-600 border-purple-300';  // NEW
  if (dayStatus.isSecondSaturday) return 'bg-blue-50 text-blue-600';
  // ... rest of the logic
};
```

#### **Updated Legend:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <div className="w-3 h-3 bg-purple-50 border border-purple-300 rounded"></div>
  <span>Company Leave (Holiday)</span>  {/* NEW */}
</div>
```

## Visual Changes

### Calendar View Legend:

**Before:**
- ‚úÖ Green: Complete Entry (‚â•4h)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow: Partial Entry (<4h)
- ‚ùå Red: Missing Entry
- üîµ Blue: 2nd Saturday
- ‚ö™ Gray: Sunday/Future

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Green: Complete Entry (‚â•4h)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow: Partial Entry (<4h)
- ‚ùå Red: Missing Entry
- **üü£ Purple: Company Leave (Holiday)** ‚Üê NEW
- üîµ Blue: 2nd Saturday
- ‚ö™ Gray: Sunday/Future

### Tooltip Messages:

**Leave Day Hover:**
```
Before: "No entry" (‚ùå Red background)
After: "Company Leave Day (Holiday/Festival)" (üü£ Purple background)
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Admin Sets Leave Day:
1. **Admin** ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Leave Management
2. Add date: `January 26, 2025` (Republic Day)
3. Save

### Inspection Page Updates:
1. **Fetches leave dates** on page load
2. **Excludes from calculations**:
   - Total work days: 21 ‚Üí 20 days
   - Missing entries: Not counted
3. **Calendar shows purple**:
   - Visual indicator: Purple background
   - Tooltip: "Company Leave Day"
4. **Compliance accurate**:
   - Before: 20/21 = 95.2% ‚ùå
   - After: 20/20 = 100% ‚úÖ

---

## Example Calculations

### January 2025 with Republic Day (Jan 26):

**Without Leave Day Fix (Before):**
```
Total days in January: 31
Sundays: 5 (Jan 5, 12, 19, 26)
2nd Saturday: 1 (Jan 11)
Work days: 31 - 5 - 1 = 25 days

User worked: 24 days (missed Jan 26 - Republic Day)
Compliance: 24/25 = 96% ‚ùå WRONG (leave day counted as work day)
```

**With Leave Day Fix (After):**
```
Total days in January: 31
Sundays: 5
2nd Saturday: 1
Leave days: 1 (Jan 26 - Republic Day) ‚Üê EXCLUDED
Work days: 31 - 5 - 1 - 1 = 24 days

User worked: 24 days
Compliance: 24/24 = 100% ‚úÖ CORRECT (leave day excluded)
```

---

## API Integration

The fix uses the existing `/api/leaves` endpoint:

### Request:
```typescript
GET /api/leaves
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "leaves": [
      {
        "_id": "...",
        "date": "2025-01-26T00:00:00.000Z",
        "reason": "Republic Day",
        "createdBy": "admin-user-id",
        "createdAt": "2025-01-20T10:30:00.000Z"
      },
      {
        "date": "2025-03-08T00:00:00.000Z",
        "reason": "Holi Festival",
        // ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Processing:
```typescript
leaves.map(leave => formatDateForAPI(new Date(leave.date)))
// Result: ["2025-01-26", "2025-03-08", ...]
// Stored in Set for O(1) lookup
```

## Quick Reference

### Color Codes:
- üü¢ Green: Complete entry (‚â•4h worked)
- üü° Yellow: Partial entry (<4h worked)

```
Compliance % = (Days Worked / Expected Work Days) √ó 100

Expected Work Days = Total Days
                    - Sundays
                    - 2nd Saturdays
                    - Company Leave Days ‚úÖ NEW
                    - Future Dates
```

Now the Inspection dashboard correctly recognizes company holidays and festivals! üéâ
